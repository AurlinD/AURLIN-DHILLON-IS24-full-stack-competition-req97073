## Notes

Frontend: React.

Backend: Nodejs, Express.

Virtualization: Docker.

There is a deprecation warning that is still pending to be fixed from my research after running the Docker compile. 

Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000/

Backend runs on http://localhost:3008/api/ (Example: http://localhost:3008/api/products for GET request)

Health URL is http://localhost:3008/api/healthcheck


## Getting Started

1. Clone repository.
2. CD into frontend subfolder, run `npm install`
3. CD into backend subfolder, run `npm install`
